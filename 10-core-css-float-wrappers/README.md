Nested Floats
</h1>

### In this activity, we're going to be examining nested float elements and how they behave

1. Add a border to every `<div>` element

2. Float `<img>` tags to the left so that text flows around them

3. Float one of the divs to the left and one to the right
  * You will have to make new selectors inside the style tags in order to do this
  * Do not edit any code below the indicated line
